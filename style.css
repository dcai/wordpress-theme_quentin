"When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and eight oclock and then I 
was in time again, hearing the watch. It was Grandfather's and when Father gave it to me he said I give 
you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; itâ€™s rather excruciating-ly apt that you will use it to gain the 
reducto absurdum of all human experience which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his 
or his father's. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then 
for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said.
They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an 
illusion of philosophers and fools."
--Quentin Compson, from "The Sound and the Fury"
